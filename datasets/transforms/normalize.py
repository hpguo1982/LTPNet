    This transform does not support PIL Image.
    Given mean: ``(mean[1],...,mean[n])`` and std: ``(std[1],..,std[n])`` for ``n``
    channels, this transform will normalize each channel of the input
    ``torch.*Tensor`` i.e.,
    ``output[channel] = (input[channel] - mean[channel]) / std[channel]``

        This transform acts out of place, i.e., it does not mutate the input tensor.

        mean (sequence): Sequence of means for each channel.
        std (sequence): Sequence of standard deviations for each channel.
        inplace(bool,optional): Bool to make this operation in-place.
